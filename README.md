# vector_set-boost-tests

Initial project for my Object-Oriented Analysis and Modeling C++ course. I was given a custom vector_set class created by
my professor and I was responsible for creating all possible unit tests using the Boost library. My professor would then
insert 10 bugs into the vector_set header file, that would be caught and reported by my Boost unit tests.

The grading on this project was successfully finding the 10 inserted bugs into the header file. Other marks were awarded for clean
project setup.
